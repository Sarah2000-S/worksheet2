	<p>The emblem of my country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, consists of two crossed, curved Arab swords, topped by a palm tree. The two swords symbolize strength, fortitude and sacrifice, while the palm tree symbolizes vitality, growth and patience.</p> 
	
	<br>
	
<p>Saudi Arabia enjoys special importance among the countries of the Islamic world and the world in general because it contains in its territory the most important holy places, the Holy House and the Prophet’s Mosque. It is also one of the countries that has become a political weight that is calculated at the level of the region and especially with its continuous quest for leadership. <a href="file:///C:/Users/Huawei-PC/Desktop/aboutme.html">(More about me)</a> <br>
